## Introduction

Fraud detection is a critical challenge for financial institutions and online businesses. In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to build a robust fraud detection system using TensorFlow. The project focuses on binary classification, identifying whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains transaction data, with each transaction labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. For privacy reasons, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can use any publicly available fraud detection dataset to follow along with the notebook.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to set up your Python environment with the necessary dependencies. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jerry10501/predicting-fraud-with-tensorflow.git
    cd predicting-fraud-with-tensorflow
  

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
  

3. Install the required packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage

Open the `predicting-fraud-with-tensorflow.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and follow the steps to preprocess the data, build the model, train it, and evaluate its performance.

jupyter notebook predicting-fraud-with-tensorflow.ipynb


## Model

The model is built using TensorFlow and includes the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the dataset.
2. **Model Building**: Creating a neural network with TensorFlow.
3. **Training**: Training the model using the training dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance on the test dataset.

## Results

After training the model, various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to evaluate its effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions. Detailed results and visualizations are provided in the notebook.
